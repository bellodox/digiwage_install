Digiwage install guide

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This setup is for a win/linux combo (COLD) wallet setup.  
- If you have zero experience with linux, you can still make it through with some patience 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

************************************ WINDOWS (or mac) go to your local(windows) wallet ***********************************
You should send all of your coins to your windows wallet from the exchange.  
send to your primary/default address (you can find it in file->receiving addresses.  
You need slightly over 12000 coins to cover the fees.

Wait until your coins arrive & are confirmed (can verify confirmed in the transactions tab)
Go to File->receiving addresses.
Create a new address, label it MN1.
Send exactly 12000 coins to that address.  You are just sending coins to yourself at a secondary wallet address. 
ONE TRANSACTION.  EXACTLY 12000.  Do NOT add in extra to cover the fees!
Wait for a few confirms in the transactions tab, the full amount won’t show, but the fee will.

Open the console: Tools->debug console.
Type: masternode outputs
You should get output that looks something like this:
"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" : "0"
Copy & save this to a file, you will need in a minute.
The first part is your txid.  The second part is your tx index.  

If that didn’t work, stop, you’re already broken.  
Did you send exactly 12000 coins? 12000.1 is not 12000, 
most common mistake is people send extra coins to their MN address.  
Your primary can have the extra, your MN needs exactly 12000.   

In the debug console, type:
masternode genkey
copy/save that output to a file.  Don’t lose it, you will need it for the VPS setup
You will use the genkey & txid in just a minute for window conf...

Now edit two windows conf files, just use notepad.  
Find conf files in: c:\users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Digiwage
(mac users: /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Digiwage/)

Open the digiwage.conf:
Make it look exactly like this (replace with your own pass)
rpcuser=digiwage
rpcpassword=any_random_string_here_you_do_not_need_to_remember_it
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=46002

Save it.

Open the masternode.conf file (use notepad).
Make it look exactly like this, but swap out your vps IP, genkey, and txid from above
Also, your index which was probably 0
MN1 VPSIP:46003 your_genkey_goes_here your_tx_id_goes_here index_id_num_here

that's it, that file only needs 1 line (unless you have 2 MN, then it will have 2 lines, etc).
Save it.

Close the wallet and re-open to load the new configs.
Go back to the console:
startmasternode alias false MN1
It should start!
do this to check it's windows status:
masternode list-conf
you want to see ENABLED


***************************** LINUX VPS setup (part 1) *************************************************************
#I personally use a fairly small linux instance, 1024memory, ubuntu, 16.04
#a lot of people use vultr, the $5 instance.  but any vps will do.  stick with ubuntu 16.04 for this guide, though.
#there are tons of vps services like: ovh, vpsdime, vultr, digitalocean, etc, etc.
#get the vps ip they gave you, you will need that for the windows setup
#you will use putty (on windows) or the terminal on mac.  If you do not know anything about putty, 
#watch a quick youtube video.
***************************************************************************************** 

#after connecting should see something like: root@whatever_your_server_name_is
#copy all instructions one line at a time:

#first we will create a new user, we do not want to install as root
#so let's create a user called digiwage1
#it's going to ask you questions like room number, you can just hit enter for all those, all you really need to fill in 
#is the new user password, do not lose this password either, you need both the root & saga1 password from now on

adduser digiwage1

#now give this user sudo access (more power!)
usermod -aG sudo digiwage1

#switch to that user:
su - digiwage1
cd ~/

#now, you should be logged in as that new user, and we download and run the install script:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digiwage/digiwage_install/master/digiwage_install.sh
sudo chmod +x digiwage_install.sh
sh digiwage_install.sh
#you WILL NEED your genkey you created in the windows steps, copy it, right click to paste when asked for it
#enter y at the end to enable firewall

#your wallet should now be running, verify:
digiwage-cli getinfo

#look at the block count.  we need to let it sync up to the current block 
#take a break, let the wallet sync.  Then check the block count again:
digiwage-cli getinfo
#once the block count is up to date, continue....

#verify masternode is running, you want a status of "successfully started"
digiwage-cli masternode status

#what if it doesn't show active???
#DEBUG RULES:
if it doesn't show active and instead get something like "waiting for activation..."
wait a couple minutes, try status again
if not, go back to windows and shut-down, restart wallet.
Do all of the following in the windows wallet debug/console:
startmasternode alias false MN1 (use whatever you named your MN)
verify it's enabled in: masternode list-conf
see that it's showing enabled in: masternode list  
If everything is good there, try again in LINUX VPS:
digiwage-cli masternode status
if it's still not good, stop and restart it in the VPS:
digiwage-cli stop
digiwaged
still not good?  Wait 5 min and repeat all debug steps.  


#SUCCESS:
#at that point you should be good, but it's always a good idea to double check on an external site:
#full disclosure, the site I'm recommending is mine (mnode.club)  
#add to your "watchlist" to get an email alert if the node goes down and when you receive rewards
#will take 5 minutes for a new node to load into the system

#FYI: HELPFUL commands in the VPS:
digiwaged #starts wallet/masternode 
digiwage-cli stop #stops 
digiwage-cli masternode status #you want a status of successfully started
digiwage-cli masternode debug
digiwage-cli masternode list #shows all nodes
digiwage-cli getinfo #show blocks, etc.
digiwage-cli help #shows every possible command

#HELPFUL IN WINDOWS CONSOLE
startmasternode alias false MN1
masternode list
masternode list-conf

#wait for rewards, possibly 24+ hours.
#Also, now that your MN is running, good time to backup your windows wallet.dat file to a usb drive, etc!
#you may monitor your node with email alerts for status and rewards at:
https://mnode.club/g/nodes/WAGE
